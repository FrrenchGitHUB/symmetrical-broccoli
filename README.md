Welcome to the README.
The file you downloaded is just this text..
Thank you anyway for installing it and taking the trouble to read this text
I'm starting on GitHub and the only thing I know how to do is a README so...
So I'm going to tell a story...
Once upon a time, there was a person who could read the future 
FAKE ! I'm not telling a story on the text sorry for the false hope...
